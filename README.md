There are six tiers for this assessment that will get more difficult
with each tier. Beginning with Tier 3, they will begin working off 
previous work. So for example, tier 4 may use a db table constructed 
in tier 3. Therefore, it is vital that each tier be completed before
moving on to the next. Also, the automation will check each tier 
iterably and will stop when it reaches an incomplete tier.

You will begin by moving branches to tier 1 and completing
the prompts given in the markdown file. after the successful
completion of the requirements, you can move to the tier 2
branch and complete those requirements. tiers 3 through 6 
will all be in the same tier.

To submit your work, push your changes to the respective 
branch. Your trainer can verify if the tier was successfully
completed. 

Your score is a compilation of the number of tiers completed
and the total number of points accumulated. It is important 
that this is understood and it will be your decision if you
continue to gather points on the current tier or move on to
the next (the minimum number of points to move on to the 
next tier is not equal to the total number of points able to 
be acquired).

**WARNING**

Do not alter the files in the test folder for any reason
whatsoever.
